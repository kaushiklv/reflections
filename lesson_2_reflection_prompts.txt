What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It adds some meta data regarding the files present in the directory and these files can later be committed on git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
It is a logical area which gives us more power to play around with the files. So when we add the files they get added to the staging area first and this then gives us the opportunity to choose which of these files to commit thus gives us more value.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
I just added the required files to the staging area logically. Then I commited those files in the staging area.
